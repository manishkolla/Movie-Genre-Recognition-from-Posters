## Abstract
This paper proposes a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based method for automatic movie genre
classification from poster images. The proposed CNN
architecture utilizes a multi-layered structure trained on a
large dataset of movie posters. The paper details the CNN
design, training process, and data pre-processing techniques
employed. Data pre-processing includes one-hot encoding
genre labels, handling missing values, addressing data
imbalance, and image re-sizing/normalization. The
performance of the proposed CNN is evaluated and compared
against established models like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG variants,
ResNet-50, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
